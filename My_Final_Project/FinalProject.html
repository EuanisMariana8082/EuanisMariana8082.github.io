    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>For this project, I was to pick a topic that I cared about. Being myself, I initially thought cancer genomics would be a great choice. It might have been, but it was difficult to explain, let alone just downloading the database on cancer genomics. After conducting research and taking a closer look, I decided to focus on stats about Bad Bunny instead. Bad Bunny is an artist who started in 2016 and now, he is one of the most streamed artists. He has captured many hearts for never forgetting his roots and for changing stereotypes around the world. He is known for being himself, not caring what others think, and most importantly, for making music that is upbeat.</p>
